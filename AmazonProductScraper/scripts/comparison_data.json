Android tablet computers have really improved since I bought the old Samsung.I have a Samsung laptop and smartphone; they connect seamlessly and transferring data and media is a breeze.I knew the new tablet would be another Samsung.What I was unprepared for was how much I LOVE this Galaxy Tab A9+ (2024 version). The A9+ was released in 2023 and 2024. The latter has an improved chipset (Snapdragon) and is updated to Android 14. Otherwise, they are identical.The A9+ has an 11\" screen and is lightweight and thin enough to put a cover on and carry in my handbag.The display is bright, smooth and videos look beautiful. I have already used it for virtual meetings. Games run perfectly (though I will say up front that I don't run any graphics-intensive games).This tablet has checked all the boxes for my needs.And get this: for the 64gb model, I paid just $159.00, brand new.I cannot imagine how many bells and whistles are packed into tablets costing ten times more, especially when the A9 is everything I could ask for.I will continue to attend virtual meetings, as well as journaling and some digital art.I added an active stylus for the art; it's a great combo!So far. I've encountered no negative attributes.If you want a great little tablet for general computing and don't want to spend a fortune, don't hesitate trying the Galaxy Tab A9+.This tablet would make a fantastic gift!Read more",

          "text": "I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and let me tell you why and how I came to this one:My husband gave my toddler his old Android Galaxy tablet a year ago and it has since died. It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do. When it died, I found an Amazon fire kids tablet, which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids, there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as it's all through Amazon.I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues. We could download the apps we wanted but they were different- youtube kids for example. It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content. It was preloaded with \"teacher approved\" content for the age range. It had complete brain cells killing trash on it. I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up. The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well.It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase! It is everything we need and were looking for! The size is perfect, the picture quality is great, set up was a breeze, it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too! It has a fast speed and it all works great. It doesn't get hot and it doesn't ever freeze! The price is super reasonable too, especially for what you are getting.Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I don't want my son messing with. I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing. I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch. I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps (lucas and friends) and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning- ABCs, numbers, learning how to spell, how to write, easy math, puzzles, etc.I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out.  If anything happens to this one, I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew.  I can also use this for myself as well.I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it.  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLYCJZTH?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_titleRead more",

          "text": "I have had this CPU for around exactly one year now. Normally I do all my tech reviews fairly early but I wanted to really use this chip, overclock it, game, and do lighting editing as well. To start off my full system is a Ryzen 5800X, Asus X570-Pro board, 32GB of 3600mhz G.Skill CL16 memory (4x8GB), EVGA G3 Supernova 850 watt 80+ Gold PSU, EVGA RTX 2070 Super GPU, Cooler Master NR600 Case, Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black Edition CPU cooler. I have two Gen 4 NVMe drives and 4 normal sata SSD drives. My case is filled with all Cooler Master Masterpro ARGB high CFM airflow fans. I’m also using an internal wireless card as well as my particular x570 board doesn’t come with onboard WiFi. My reason for stating all this is the airflow and cooling in my case is exceptional. I have one of the highest airflow cases, with some of the best fans, one of the best CPU coolers, and I’m using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaunt paste which is hands down the best CPU test for overclocking and temps in general imo. Stating all this because YOUR temps may be different than mine as well as your results. To start of with the chip I’ve not had ONE single issue with it so far after a year of use. ALL I have done to it after installing it in place of the Ryzen 3600 that it replaced was I enabled DOCP on my memory which is AMDs version of XMP and I enabled PBO on my chip with the max limit set at 200mhz. That it all I touched. This chip boosts to 5.1ghz when using 2-3 cores or less easily and even if under full load will still stay around 4.75ghz on all 8 cores at 100% load. In a more realistic load like gaming it runs around 4.75-4.95ghz. Under full load like Prime95 my temps top out around 74C. Idle is around low 30s and while gaming it bounces around 55-65C. It runs super fast and super cool. This is all on air cooling too. When going from the 3600 to the 5800X while every single other aspect of my system remained the same I gained anywhere from 10 fps to over 20 fps on some games. I play at 1440P as well. If you play at 1080P your results will be even better. This is the best chip I’ve ever used and owned. My RTX 2070 Super is overclocked 1100mhz on the memory and 140mhz on the core. On benchmarks my scores beat all stock and even factory OC 2080 Supers. They also beat almost all RTX 3060 ti results as well. I’ve never played a single game where this chip bottlenecks my card ever. Whereas with the 3600 it did from time to time. Especially in games using DLSS which renders the game at a much lower resolution then upscales it. That makes the game way more CPU demanding and in titles with DLSS my fps increase was huge. Absolutely amazing cpu for gaming and you don’t have to do anything other than enable PBO. Gone are the days of manual overclocking to get all the performance you paid for. The chips auto boost themselfs as high as they can go basically all by themselves now. If you have any Zen + or Zen 2 chip and wanna upgrade to Zen 3 aka Ryzen 5000 I say it’s well worth it for gaming. The IPC increase on Ryzen 5000 over 3000 series is huge. Over 30% faster. I’ve included pictures of my setup, CPUz info, benchmark results, MSI Afterburner temperature info after playing Witcher 3 at 1440P on Ultra settings for hours, and many other others. The chip boosts high, runs cool, requires basically no knowledge to get max performance from it outside of TWO toggles in the bios, and at its current price is an amazing value imo. Fast enough to pair any GPU on the market with it if you can find one. I’ve been wanting a 3080 forever now but just no luck. I paid the MSRP of 450 for this chip and don’t regret it at all. No crashes, no issues ever, never breaks 70C while daily use/gaming no matter how long, boosts over 5ghz, and has enough cores/threads if you wanna stream and multitask while gaming you’re good to go. I think AMD did an amazing job with Zen 3 and if you’re interested in the 5800X for gaming/streaming you won’t go wrong. Hope this review helped and if it does please leave a like. Enjoy the pics and thanks for reading.Read more",

          "text": "so, i was one of the (statistically few) who hit the silicon lottery and struck dirt. basically, my 5800x was defective. this is just a PSA, if you encounter BSODs/crashes to reboot/fatal hardware errors after installing your new CPU, it is likely defective. i was getting WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR at random times, event IDs WHEA-18 and 46. no combination of the CPU with a new motherboard, different ram, 1 stick of ram, XMP profiles off, PBO disabled, bios updates, windows reinstalls, chipset driver updates, or other device driver updates resolved the issue for me. it would occur under any load at any temperature. it's also worth mentioning that it worked fine for about 5 days before issues started to happen. if your PC is producing errors you simply cannot resolve and it started with the new CPU, please return it ASAP!! i have ordered a new one already and shipped the defective unit back. i used my old ryzen 2600 to isolate the 5800x as the issue, and my system runs completely stable as long as i keep it on. i'm sad it was defective, but ultimately, i'm not going to let it damage my opinion of the CPU, as defective products are guaranteed to slip through here and there, and amazon is extremely good about their return policy in my experience.anyway, with that out of the way, let's talk about the CPU itself. when mine was functioning normally, it was awesome. coming from an old ryzen 5 2600, the performance gain of the 5800x is a night and day difference. it's 3 years old now, but its price and still-relevant performance make it an immensely good value. it squeezed new fps gains out of my gtx 1080, and was far more than enough for my new rtx 4070. the gains in performance are even more obvious now that i'm back on the 2600 while i wait for my replacement to arrive. it was as easy to install as any other AM3/AM4 CPU. i will give a heads up however that it does run hot and is known to do so. however, AMD has explicitly stated that even 90°C is safe at full load. a high quality air cooler will be enough if you don't plan on doing serious overclocking, like me. a thermalright peerless assassin or scythe fuma should be more than enough for stock clocks with PBO left on auto. i paired this with 32gb of gskill ripjaws V with 3600mhz XMP profile, and the two paired wonderfully. the motherboard i ended up with is an MSI MAG B550 tomahawk max wifi, but the CPU will work just fine on most B450/X470 motherboards as long as your bios is up to date!!!! please do not let my disclaimer dissuade you from buying this amazing CPU, it can happen to anyone who buys any CPU, from Intel too! i can't wait for my replacement to arrive and complete my system, i wholeheartedly recommend this CPU for great performance per dollar.Read more",

AMDs support of the AM4 platform for so long has really allowed people to stretch out the lifespan of their older systems providing a nice upgrade path even still.I  read that it can run hot but so far the hyper 212 halo I got for it is doing a great job keeping it cool. I don't plan on any overclocking.  Would have liked a 5800x3D but the price is too much for me.  For what I play it would have been overkill anyway.AMD has come a long way and their CPU's and GPUs are of great value for performance.Read more",

Actualmente tengo mi computadora junto con una rtx 3060 y me parece que el rendimiento es óptimo y de mucha calidad.Mi computadora tiene una refrigeración bastante buena creo yo, por lo que no me preocupa medir las temperaturas. Además, tampoco soy el tipo de usuario que se dedica a ver estadísticas para ver cuánto rendimiento están dando los programas que ejecuto. Lo más que hago es usar la aplicación de Nvidia y ver los porcentajes que me brinda. Mi experiencia de juego es buena y eso es suficiente para mí. Tengo claro que para aprovechar al máximo este procesador es importante la refrigeración que se le pueda dar, por lo que las recomendaciones que yo daría para comprar este procesador son dos:-- En verdad considera la refrigeración y el espacio de tu gabinete, serán de mucha ayuda para que permita al procesador trabajar con libertad.-- Los componentes que acompañan al procesador deben ser acorde a la calidad de este. No me refiero al precio o marca, más bien al rendimiento que deben dar para no causar un cuello de botella excesivo.Read more",

La CPU y la gráfica trabajan a un  60% de uso, con un rendimiento fluido y sin cuellos de botella. Además, las temperaturas se mantienen bajo control, con el procesador rondando los 65 ºC en plena acción.⚙️ Este modelo de procesador sigue siendo una apuesta segura para gaming y multitarea. Su configuración de 8 núcleos y 16 hilos ofrece una experiencia muy equilibrada, incluso para títulos exigentes. Lo más destacable es su capacidad para mantener una alta frecuencia sin penalizar la eficiencia energética, aunque bajo carga máxima requiere un sistema de refrigeración competente.Lo que mucha gente no sabe, es que este modelo de Ryzen no viene con gráficos integrados en el procesador, por lo que si lo montas sin tarjeta gráfica, no tendrás salida de vídeo por tu placa base. Para ello vas a necesitar comprar una tarjeta gráfica dedicada. Si quieres un procesador con gráficos integrados, son los que terminan en G, como éste: https://amzn.to/4gqHoU3🛠️ A pesar de no ser de última generación, su relación calidad-precio lo hace destacar frente a opciones más recientes. El montaje del PC fue sencillo con los componentes que elegí, y hasta ahora, todo ha funcionado como esperaba. Lo más importante: no hay caídas de rendimiento ni problemas de compatibilidad.Personalmente, resulta más seguro montar procesadores AMD que Intel. Las diferencias entre ellos, es que lo intel, los procesadores son planos y el socket tiene los pines, pero es muy fácil que se doblen los pines. En el AMD, los pines están en el procesador y salvo que te caiga, no vas a tener problemas por montar y desmontar sin dañar las patillas. Me dan mayor seguridad.✅ CONCLUSIÓNAunque lanzado en 2020, sigue siendo una opción actual y eficiente, perfectamente válido para gaming sin comprometer temperaturas ni rendimiento.👍 RECOMENDABLE.✳️ Espero que mi comentario ✍️ te haya podido servir de ayuda 😃Read more",

            "text": "so, i was one of the (statistically few) who hit the silicon lottery and struck dirt. basically, my 5800x was defective. this is just a PSA, if you encounter BSODs/crashes to reboot/fatal hardware errors after installing your new CPU, it is likely defective. i was getting WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR at random times, event IDs WHEA-18 and 46. no combination of the CPU with a new motherboard, different ram, 1 stick of ram, XMP profiles off, PBO disabled, bios updates, windows reinstalls, chipset driver updates, or other device driver updates resolved the issue for me. it would occur under any load at any temperature. it's also worth mentioning that it worked fine for about 5 days before issues started to happen. if your PC is producing errors you simply cannot resolve and it started with the new CPU, please return it ASAP!! i have ordered a new one already and shipped the defective unit back. i used my old ryzen 2600 to isolate the 5800x as the issue, and my system runs completely stable as long as i keep it on. i'm sad it was defective, but ultimately, i'm not going to let it damage my opinion of the CPU, as defective products are guaranteed to slip through here and there, and amazon is extremely good about their return policy in my experience.anyway, with that out of the way, let's talk about the CPU itself. when mine was functioning normally, it was awesome. coming from an old ryzen 5 2600, the performance gain of the 5800x is a night and day difference. it's 3 years old now, but its price and still-relevant performance make it an immensely good value. it squeezed new fps gains out of my gtx 1080, and was far more than enough for my new rtx 4070. the gains in performance are even more obvious now that i'm back on the 2600 while i wait for my replacement to arrive. it was as easy to install as any other AM3/AM4 CPU. i will give a heads up however that it does run hot and is known to do so. however, AMD has explicitly stated that even 90°C is safe at full load. a high quality air cooler will be enough if you don't plan on doing serious overclocking, like me. a thermalright peerless assassin or scythe fuma should be more than enough for stock clocks with PBO left on auto. i paired this with 32gb of gskill ripjaws V with 3600mhz XMP profile, and the two paired wonderfully. the motherboard i ended up with is an MSI MAG B550 tomahawk max wifi, but the CPU will work just fine on most B450/X470 motherboards as long as your bios is up to date!!!! please do not let my disclaimer dissuade you from buying this amazing CPU, it can happen to anyone who buys any CPU, from Intel too! i can't wait for my replacement to arrive and complete my system, i wholeheartedly recommend this CPU for great performance per dollar.Read more",

            "text": "I have had this CPU for around exactly one year now. Normally I do all my tech reviews fairly early but I wanted to really use this chip, overclock it, game, and do lighting editing as well. To start off my full system is a Ryzen 5800X, Asus X570-Pro board, 32GB of 3600mhz G.Skill CL16 memory (4x8GB), EVGA G3 Supernova 850 watt 80+ Gold PSU, EVGA RTX 2070 Super GPU, Cooler Master NR600 Case, Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black Edition CPU cooler. I have two Gen 4 NVMe drives and 4 normal sata SSD drives. My case is filled with all Cooler Master Masterpro ARGB high CFM airflow fans. I’m also using an internal wireless card as well as my particular x570 board doesn’t come with onboard WiFi. My reason for stating all this is the airflow and cooling in my case is exceptional. I have one of the highest airflow cases, with some of the best fans, one of the best CPU coolers, and I’m using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaunt paste which is hands down the best CPU test for overclocking and temps in general imo. Stating all this because YOUR temps may be different than mine as well as your results. To start of with the chip I’ve not had ONE single issue with it so far after a year of use. ALL I have done to it after installing it in place of the Ryzen 3600 that it replaced was I enabled DOCP on my memory which is AMDs version of XMP and I enabled PBO on my chip with the max limit set at 200mhz. That it all I touched. This chip boosts to 5.1ghz when using 2-3 cores or less easily and even if under full load will still stay around 4.75ghz on all 8 cores at 100% load. In a more realistic load like gaming it runs around 4.75-4.95ghz. Under full load like Prime95 my temps top out around 74C. Idle is around low 30s and while gaming it bounces around 55-65C. It runs super fast and super cool. This is all on air cooling too. When going from the 3600 to the 5800X while every single other aspect of my system remained the same I gained anywhere from 10 fps to over 20 fps on some games. I play at 1440P as well. If you play at 1080P your results will be even better. This is the best chip I’ve ever used and owned. My RTX 2070 Super is overclocked 1100mhz on the memory and 140mhz on the core. On benchmarks my scores beat all stock and even factory OC 2080 Supers. They also beat almost all RTX 3060 ti results as well. I’ve never played a single game where this chip bottlenecks my card ever. Whereas with the 3600 it did from time to time. Especially in games using DLSS which renders the game at a much lower resolution then upscales it. That makes the game way more CPU demanding and in titles with DLSS my fps increase was huge. Absolutely amazing cpu for gaming and you don’t have to do anything other than enable PBO. Gone are the days of manual overclocking to get all the performance you paid for. The chips auto boost themselfs as high as they can go basically all by themselves now. If you have any Zen + or Zen 2 chip and wanna upgrade to Zen 3 aka Ryzen 5000 I say it’s well worth it for gaming. The IPC increase on Ryzen 5000 over 3000 series is huge. Over 30% faster. I’ve included pictures of my setup, CPUz info, benchmark results, MSI Afterburner temperature info after playing Witcher 3 at 1440P on Ultra settings for hours, and many other others. The chip boosts high, runs cool, requires basically no knowledge to get max performance from it outside of TWO toggles in the bios, and at its current price is an amazing value imo. Fast enough to pair any GPU on the market with it if you can find one. I’ve been wanting a 3080 forever now but just no luck. I paid the MSRP of 450 for this chip and don’t regret it at all. No crashes, no issues ever, never breaks 70C while daily use/gaming no matter how long, boosts over 5ghz, and has enough cores/threads if you wanna stream and multitask while gaming you’re good to go. I think AMD did an amazing job with Zen 3 and if you’re interested in the 5800X for gaming/streaming you won’t go wrong. Hope this review helped and if it does please leave a like. Enjoy the pics and thanks for reading.Read more",

La CPU y la gráfica trabajan a un  60% de uso, con un rendimiento fluido y sin cuellos de botella. Además, las temperaturas se mantienen bajo control, con el procesador rondando los 65 ºC en plena acción.⚙️ Este modelo de procesador sigue siendo una apuesta segura para gaming y multitarea. Su configuración de 8 núcleos y 16 hilos ofrece una experiencia muy equilibrada, incluso para títulos exigentes. Lo más destacable es su capacidad para mantener una alta frecuencia sin penalizar la eficiencia energética, aunque bajo carga máxima requiere un sistema de refrigeración competente.Lo que mucha gente no sabe, es que este modelo de Ryzen no viene con gráficos integrados en el procesador, por lo que si lo montas sin tarjeta gráfica, no tendrás salida de vídeo por tu placa base. Para ello vas a necesitar comprar una tarjeta gráfica dedicada. Si quieres un procesador con gráficos integrados, son los que terminan en G, como éste: https://amzn.to/4gqHoU3🛠️ A pesar de no ser de última generación, su relación calidad-precio lo hace destacar frente a opciones más recientes. El montaje del PC fue sencillo con los componentes que elegí, y hasta ahora, todo ha funcionado como esperaba. Lo más importante: no hay caídas de rendimiento ni problemas de compatibilidad.Personalmente, resulta más seguro montar procesadores AMD que Intel. Las diferencias entre ellos, es que lo intel, los procesadores son planos y el socket tiene los pines, pero es muy fácil que se doblen los pines. En el AMD, los pines están en el procesador y salvo que te caiga, no vas a tener problemas por montar y desmontar sin dañar las patillas. Me dan mayor seguridad.✅ CONCLUSIÓNAunque lanzado en 2020, sigue siendo una opción actual y eficiente, perfectamente válido para gaming sin comprometer temperaturas ni rendimiento.👍 RECOMENDABLE.✳️ Espero que mi comentario ✍️ te haya podido servir de ayuda 😃Read more",

Actualmente tengo mi computadora junto con una rtx 3060 y me parece que el rendimiento es óptimo y de mucha calidad.Mi computadora tiene una refrigeración bastante buena creo yo, por lo que no me preocupa medir las temperaturas. Además, tampoco soy el tipo de usuario que se dedica a ver estadísticas para ver cuánto rendimiento están dando los programas que ejecuto. Lo más que hago es usar la aplicación de Nvidia y ver los porcentajes que me brinda. Mi experiencia de juego es buena y eso es suficiente para mí. Tengo claro que para aprovechar al máximo este procesador es importante la refrigeración que se le pueda dar, por lo que las recomendaciones que yo daría para comprar este procesador son dos:-- En verdad considera la refrigeración y el espacio de tu gabinete, serán de mucha ayuda para que permita al procesador trabajar con libertad.-- Los componentes que acompañan al procesador deben ser acorde a la calidad de este. No me refiero al precio o marca, más bien al rendimiento que deben dar para no causar un cuello de botella excesivo.Read more",
