        "text": "I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and let me tell you why and how I came to this one:My husband gave my toddler his old Android Galaxy tablet a year ago and it has since died. It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do. When it died, I found an Amazon fire kids tablet, which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids, there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as it's all through Amazon.I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues. We could download the apps we wanted but they were different- youtube kids for example. It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content. It was preloaded with \"teacher approved\" content for the age range. It had complete brain cells killing trash on it. I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up. The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well.It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase! It is everything we need and were looking for! The size is perfect, the picture quality is great, set up was a breeze, it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too! It has a fast speed and it all works great. It doesn't get hot and it doesn't ever freeze! The price is super reasonable too, especially for what you are getting.Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I don't want my son messing with. I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing. I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch. I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps (lucas and friends) and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning- ABCs, numbers, learning how to spell, how to write, easy math, puzzles, etc.I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out.  If anything happens to this one, I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew.  I can also use this for myself as well.I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it.  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLYCJZTH?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_titleRead more",
