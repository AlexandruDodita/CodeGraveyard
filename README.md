# 🪦 CodeGraveyard

A collection of various personal projects that are either:
- Unfinished but functional
- Too small to deserve their own repository
- No longer maintained

Each project may still have educational or practical value, and this graveyard serves both as a snapshot of ideas and as a base for future resurrection.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🛒 Amazon Product Review Aggregator & Comparator

A Python CLI (with an optional GUI interface) tool that scrapes Amazon product reviews, analyzes sentiment, extracts pros and cons, generates AI summaries, finds similar products, and outputs JSON data for integration or inspection. It’s functionally complete but no longer actively maintained. 

Notes: 
- Needs a deepseek API key. 
- Uses bs4, which means it's probably broken because Amazon uses dynamic page loading. A better idea would have been to use Selenium instead but that's no longer my problem.

### 2. 🧱 ZombieTD - Tower Defense Game

A browser-based tower defense game built with vanilla JS, Canvas, and CSS featuring enemy pathfinding, tile-based maps, tower upgrades, resource management, and progressively harder waves. Modular and functional. 

Notes:
- There is an itch.io upload of this game somewhere. Remind me to upload the link. Or don't.
- It's more of an experiment than anything noteworthy. It was part of a one day to make a game challenge.

### 3. 🔐 Bluetooth OTP Digital Safe

An IoT-based digital safe system using Raspberry Pi Pico W that delivers 6-digit OTP codes via Bluetooth every 60 seconds for secure web-based unlocking. Features include servo-based locking, fallback offline mode, live status monitoring, and a mobile-friendly control panel.

Notes:

- A demo to the project can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JitznnkUbk
- The project was part of a college project. In retrospective, probably way too simplistic but an interesting proof of concept.
