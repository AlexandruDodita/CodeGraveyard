# 🪦 CodeGraveyard

A collection of various personal projects that are either:
- Unfinished but functional
- Too small to deserve their own repository
- No longer maintained

Each project may still have educational or practical value, and this graveyard serves both as a snapshot of ideas and as a base for future resurrection.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🛒 Amazon Product Review Aggregator & Comparator

A Python CLI (with an optional GUI interface) tool that scrapes Amazon product reviews, analyzes sentiment, extracts pros and cons, generates AI summaries, finds similar products, and outputs JSON data for integration or inspection. It’s functionally complete but no longer actively maintained. 

Notes: 
- Needs a deepseek API key. 
- Uses bs4, which means it's probably broken because Amazon uses dynamic page loading. A better idea would have been to use Selenium instead but that's no longer my problem.
